'Quick' release for WG2 demo. Should work on Macs,Linux,Windows.
Interfaces to Coot and import of XIA2 and most main xtallographic functionality but not ab initio solution.



1AUG2012

Update to the Python,Qt libraries + include mmdb, hklfile - requires reinstalling from scratch from www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~ccp4i2/downloads.  This is a gzipped tarball for mac or linux. Once it is untarred you should be able to update to the latest Python code from the ccpforge svn by:
> cd ccp4i2
> export svnroot=http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/svn/ccp4i2
> export SVN_EDITOR=vi
> svn update

Please delete old databases ( $HOME/.CCP4I2/db directory ) as database schema is updated.
Running a setup script is not necessary - running the executable bin/ccp4i2 should start up the gui.

Developers can use  utils/setup.csh (or new utils.setup.sh) to set up development environment - requires editing to set CCP4I2_TOP.

Alternative layout around the 'Report' page with links to report sections and 'what next' buttons.

Job interrupt and restart (only current example Bucanneer-Refmac). Job kill and delete tidied up.

MTZ split to functional data objects.
There are 4 tasks at top of the Job List that demonstrate this. The first will split and existing MTZ into componenets and these can be used in the subsequent parrot-buccaneer-refmac sequence.
Note that this is a demonstration and not necessarilly very flexible or robust.
The guis probably should not show a choice of freeR data if there is only one set per project.

Import Experimental Data test version
NB This does nothing and has known bugs.
This is intended to demonstate a single gui where xtaller can input all necessary info so that all subsequent processing could, in principle, just be 'Next..Run..Next..Run'. 

basic pointless-aimless-ctruncate pipeline done. Called aimless_pipe. Not very well tested, and not really release quality - from Martyn
